*rgt-R.txt*    A Vim plugin for working with R and R Markdown files

==============================================================================
NAME
    rgt-R - Interact with R and R Markdown files directly from Vim

==============================================================================
DESCRIPTION
The rgt-R plugin provides convenience mappings and commands for sending code
from R, R Markdown (`.Rmd`), and Quarto (`.qmd`) files to an R terminal
embedded within Vim. It allows you to:

- Submit the current line or a visual selection of code to R.
- Navigate and send R Markdown code chunks to R.
- Perform common R operations (e.g., `head()`, `str()`, `dim()`) on the word under the cursor.
- Break out of a running R process or R’s debugging browser.
- Render R Markdown files to PDF using `rmarkdown::render()`.

This plugin streamlines your workflow by enabling efficient interaction with R
directly from your editor, reducing context switching.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION
1. **Using Native Vim Packages** (Vim 8+):
   Place the plugin in:
==============================================================================
USAGE
Open an R, R Markdown, or Quarto file. The plugin’s mappings become available
if `FileType` is `r`, `rmd`, or `qmd`.

- Start an R terminal in Vim:

	•	Submit a visual selection to R (Visual mode):
Select a block of code visually and press <CR>. If an R terminal is open,
it sends the selection. Otherwise, a message appears.
	•	Navigate R Markdown chunks:
Use <localleader>l, <localleader>;, <localleader>k, and <localleader>j
to select and move between R Markdown code chunks, making it easy to run code
chunk-by-chunk.
	•	Perform actions on <cword>:
With the cursor over a word (e.g., an R object), use <localleader>d, <localleader>h,
and similar mappings to run R functions like dim(), head(), str() on that object.
	•	Render R Markdown file to PDF:
Use ZT in Normal mode to render the current .Rmd file using rmarkdown::render().
==============================================================================
MAPPINGS
All mappings apply to buffers of type r, rmd, and qmd only.

NORMAL MODE:
	•	<CR>                Submit current line to R, move down one line
	•	<localleader>r      Start an R terminal (vertical split)
	•	<localleader>c      Send Ctrl-C to interrupt R execution
	•	<localleader>q      Send ‘Q’ to quit R debug browser
	•	<localleader>l      Select and send the current R Markdown chunk
	•	<localleader>;      Select and send current R Markdown chunk, move to next
	•	<localleader>k      Move to previous R Markdown chunk
	•	<localleader>j      Move to next R Markdown chunk

Perform actions on the word under cursor:
	•	<localleader>d      dim(word)
	•	<localleader>h      head(word)
	•	<localleader>s      str(word)
	•	<localleader>p      print(word)
	•	<localleader>n      names(word)
	•	<localleader>f      length(word)
	•	<localleader>g      glimpse(word) (requires the dplyr or tibble package)

Other:
	•	ZT                  Render current Rmd file to PDF via rmarkdown::render()

VISUAL MODE:
	•	<CR>                Submit selected text to R if terminal is available

For embedded code submission with commented output:
	•	<localleader>z in Visual mode:
Submit selection, capture output to a temporary file, and insert commented output.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS & FUNCTIONS
These functions are mostly internal, but you can call them if needed:
	•	SubmitLine()        Submit current line to R terminal.
	•	Sel()               Select visually selected code into a temporary file.
	•	Submit()            Submit the previously selected code file to R.
	•	SubmitEmbed()       Submit and capture output into a temporary file (temp.txt).
	•	Rd()                Read the captured output and insert it as commented lines.
	•	SelectChunk()       Select current R Markdown chunk.
	•	MoveNextChunk()     Move to next R Markdown chunk.
	•	MovePrevChunk()     Move to previous R Markdown chunk.
	•	Brk()               Send Ctrl-C to break R execution.
	•	BrowserBrk()        Send ‘Q’ to exit R’s debug browser.
	•	Raction()           Perform R functions like head(), str() on <cword>.

==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS
	•	Vim 8 or higher (or Neovim) with :terminal support.
	•	R installed and accessible on your PATH.
	•	The rmarkdown R package if you plan to render .Rmd files to PDF.

==============================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
	•	If :help rgt-R doesn’t work, run :helptags on the doc directory.
	•	Ensure an R terminal is open before sending code.
	•	If chunk navigation doesn’t work, ensure your file has valid R Markdown code blocks:
